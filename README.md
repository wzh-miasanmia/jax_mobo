# jax_mobo
## purpose
The purpose of this repo is to establish the use of JAX to complete a multi-objective Bayesian optimization problem and for solving the problem in the TENO-6 format in computational fluid dynamics.

## progress
The project is currently in its early stages and progress is as follows:

Completed:
- Gaussian process using JAX including the calculation of kernel, postrior and marginal likelihood function
- Implemented encapsulation: GaussianProcessRegressor, with methods like fit, optim, predict, etc.

Plan to proceed:
- Single-objective Bayesian optimization
- Multi-objective Bayesian optimization

## How to use
```python
conda activate maenv
cd wzhmiasanmia/ma_workspace/jax_mobo/jax_sobo/
```
