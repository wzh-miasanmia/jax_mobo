# Basic implement for Multi-Objective Optimization Branch

## details
### mobo_np:
main work, complete the multi-objective bayesian optimization process using numpy
### bayesian_jax:
reference to the completed package on github has been changed to include the ability to draw 2d and 3d graphics

### sobo_jax:
complete the Bayesian optimization process using jax
noramlization problem still need to solve

### mobo_learn:
learn how to implement mobo method, according to botorch

### mobo_jax:
complete the multi-objective bayesian optimization process using JAX, still have some problems. Therefore, we will numpy-based mobo to do the optimization for CFD in the other 2 branches.
