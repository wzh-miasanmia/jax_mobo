# Results Branch

This branch is for the final 2 parts of the paper, which are optimization results and case results visualization.

For optimization results, we plot absolute local dispersion error field and turbulance kinetic energy sperctrum.

For case results, figures include 2d implosion, 2d Riemann problem, RTI and double-mach problem.
