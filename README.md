# jax_mobo
## purpose
The purpose of this repo is to establish the use of JAX to complete a multi-objective Bayesian optimization problem and for solving the problem in the TENO-6 format in computational fluid dynamics.

## progress
The project is currently in its early stages and progress is as follows:

Completed:
- Gaussian process using JAX including the calculation of kernel, postrior and marginal likelihood function

Plan to proceed:
- Single-objective Bayesian optimization
- Visualization of multi-dimensional input Gaussian processes
